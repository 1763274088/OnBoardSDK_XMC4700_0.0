EXAMPLE NAME: XMC4700_Blinky

HISTORY:
V1.0.0 initial version 

OVERVIEW: 
XMC4700/XMC4800 Blinky demo based on XMC Lib.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) "XMC4700 Relax Kit" or 
   "XMC4700 Relax Lite Kit" or
   "XMC4700 Relax Kit for 5V Shields" or 
   "XMC4800 Relax EtherCAT Kit" 
2) Micro USB Cable 
3) Windows PC/Laptop installed with DAVE v4 (Version 4.1.4 or higher)

DESCRIPTION:
This blinky example is based on the easy to use XMC Lib and flashes the led LED1 (P5.9) of the board 
with a initial periodic rate of 1.0s. Using the buttons flash rate can be adjusted in steps of 100ms.
Use Button1 (P15.13) to increase flash rate. Use Button2 (P15.12) to decrease flash rate.
After initialization of CCU4 and GPIOS to their initial settings and enabling of the interrupt,
the button states are polled inside main loop. Depending on the button pressed, the cycle time
of the periodic interrupt generated by CCU4 is increased or decreased. During interrupt of CCU4
the state of LED output port is toggled.

Source structure:
1)main.c            configuration and initialization of modules
                    poll buttons inside main loop and configure CCU4 cycle time accordingly.
                    implement ISR to toggle LED1.

XMC Lib components used:
1)XMC_CCU4_*		Configure and control of the CCU4 to trigger ISR for cyclic LED toggling
2)XMC_GPIO_*		Configure and control of LED output port and button input ports
CMSIS components used:
1)NVIC_*			Configure, control and enable interrupt of CCU4 

BUILD:
Please note, the project has to be rebuild after importing because the build result folder 
has been deleted to reduce the size.
1) Import the project
2) Build and flash the application to the device using USB X101 connection

SETUP:
1) Connect Micro USB cable to Relax Kit USB plug X101 and to a PC/laptop.

HOW TO TEST:
1) After reset.
   OBSERVATION: LED1 is toggled (on/off) with a cycle time of 1.0s 
2) Push BUTTON1 to decrease cycle time to a minimum of 0.1s.
   OBSERVATION: On/off cycle time of LED1 on port P5.9 is decreased.
3) Push BUTTON2 to increase cycle time to a maximum of 1.5s.
   OBSERVATION: On/off cycle time of LED1 on port P5.9 is increased.
